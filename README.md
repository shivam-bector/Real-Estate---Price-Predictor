# Real-Estate---Price-Predictor
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Random Forest Classifier using Python's sklearn library. The classifier is trained to predict labels based on the features provided in traindataset. It helps the real-estate business to grow by identifying the undervalued properties and investing in them in order to obtain profit in future
## Overview
The Random Forest Classifier is a versatile machine learning algorithm capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It is also used for dimensionality reduction, treats missing values, outlier values, and other essential steps of data exploration, and does a fairly good job. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.
